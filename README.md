# hcontortus_xqtl

This repository contains the analysis workflow for the manuscript under preparation
tentatively titled "Genomic landscape of drug response reveals novel mediators of anthelmintic resistance".

The code for the analysis is broken up into subsections as follows:  
- [Core informatics](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.mapping_variants.md)
- [Genome-wide analyses](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.genomewideplots.md)  
- [Benzimidazole analyses](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.benzimidazole.md)  
- [Levamisole analyses](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.levamisole.md)  
- [Ivermectin analyses](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.ivermectin.md)  
- [US field samples](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.US_field_genomewide.md)  



To recreate the figures, some data will need to be downloaded from my FTP repository, which can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/pathogens/sd21/hcontortus_xqtl/

Any reuse of data or code is encouraged with due acknowledgement, either via citation of the published manuscript (when available) and/or GitHub repository. Comments, suggestions, and discussion are welcome.
