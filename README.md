# hcontortus_xqtl

This repository contains the analysis workflow for the manuscript under preparation
tentatively titled "Forward genetic crosses and bulk segregant genomic analyses reveal genetic mediators of multi-drug resistance in *Haemonchus contortus*".

The code for the analysis is broken up into subsections as follows:  
[Core informatics](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.md)  
[Figure 1](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.figure1.md)  
[Figure 2](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.figure2.md)  
[Figure 3](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.figure3.md)  
[Figure 4](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.figure4.md)
[Supplementary Figures](https://github.com/stephenrdoyle/hcontortus_xqtl/blob/master/03_code/hcontortus_xqtl.workbook.supplementary_figures.md)  

To recreate the figures, some data will need to be downloaded from my FTP repository, which can be accessed [here](ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/project/pathogens/sd21/hcontortus_xqtl/)

Any reuse of data or code is encouraged with due acknowledgement, either via citation of the published manuscript (when available) and/or GitHub repository. Comments, suggestions, and discussion are welcome.
